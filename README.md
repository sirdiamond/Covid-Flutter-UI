# FLUTTER Covid UI 

:br: 
- I've started study Flutter and this is my second UI developed using the framework.
- I've used the UI from: [https://github.com/abuanwar072/Food-App]
- Started to use more Theme.of as a way to avoid the style boilerplate
- This UI was good to train SingleChildScrollView and ListView
